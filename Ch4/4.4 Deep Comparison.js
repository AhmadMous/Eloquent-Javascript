// The == operator compares objects by identity. But sometimes youâ€™d prefer to
// compare the values of their actual properties.
// Write a function deepEqual that takes two values and returns true only if
// they are the same value or are objects with the same properties, where the
// values of the properties are equal when compared with a recursive call to
// deepEqual .
// To find out whether values should be compared directly (use the ===
// operator for that) or have their properties compared, you can use the typeof
// operator. If it produces "object" for both values, you should do a deep com-
// parison. But you have to take one silly exception into account: because of a
// historical accident, typeof null also produces "object" .
// The Object.keys function will be useful when you need to go over the
// properties of objects to compare them.
//
// Opinion: This is really hard for a beginner who struggles with recursion, and the thought process in this book is not enough to teach
// a first timer how to solve this, but the challenge definetly should help them
