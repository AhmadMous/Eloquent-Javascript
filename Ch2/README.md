### FIZZBUZZ
> Write a program that uses `console.log` to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exeptions. For numbers
divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
>
> When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 _(and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those)_.

### CHESSBOARD
> Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8x8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" characters. The characters should form a chessboard.
> Passing this string to `console.log` should show something like this:

> When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
